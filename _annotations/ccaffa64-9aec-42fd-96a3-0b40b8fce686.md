The *Original Sacred Harp*’s editors added this fermata to “Bound for Canaan,” which unusually sits on the first syllable of a word. No recording of “Bound for Canaan” from the first half of the twentieth century documents the observance of this fermata. The editors of *Original Sacred Harp: Denson Revision* removed it in 1936.

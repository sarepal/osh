Elisha James King composed “Bound for Canaan” in three parts (tenor, bass, and treble) and contributed the revival chorus to the 1844 first edition of *The Sacred Harp*. The song appeared on page 82, where it remained unchanged during successive nineteenth-century revisions of the tunebook. “Bound for Canaan” is a perennially popular song, often used to open all-day singings from *The Sacred Harp*.

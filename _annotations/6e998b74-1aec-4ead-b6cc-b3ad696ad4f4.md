John Newton published “How tedious and tasteless the hours” in his book *Olney Hymns*. The hymn text features four verses written in 8s, double, an anapestic meter featuring eight lines of eight-syllable text. Each verse pairs a picture of gloomy resignation in the first four lines with a brighter picture of the joy that comes from beholding God’s presence in each verse’s second half. The better-known tune “Green Fields” (127) accommodates this hymn text’s full eight-line stanzas in an upbeat, major mode setting. In contrast, “Edgefield” adopts a minor melody to set just the gloomy first half of the hymn’s first verse, omitting its cheerier conclusion.

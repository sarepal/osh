In the first printing of *Original Sacred Harp*, the book’s editors shortened the first note of “Bound for Canaan” from a half note to a quarter note, and removed the half note rest which had preceded the first note in the 1844–1870 editions of *The Sacred Harp*. This subtle change brought the song into closer alignment with gospel songs, which often begin with quarter or eighth note pickups. In contrast, many songs in *The Sacred Harp* begin with half or whole notes, providing singers an opportunity to sound a strong starting chord before launching into a succession of shorter notes as the song continues. 

James made similar alterations to several other songs in the first edition of *Original Sacred Harp* but restored the original half note entrances to all of these songs in this second printing of the book. The resistance of singers to such musical modernizations likely caused the *Original Sacred Harp*’s editors to moderate their reforms. Rather than retypeset page 82, the book’s typesetters resorted to modifying the stereotyped copper plate they had produced for the book’s first edition, as a result, the song’s half rest and half note seem squeezed into the limited space previously occupied by song’s quarter note pickup.

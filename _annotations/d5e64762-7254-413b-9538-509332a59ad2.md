Jesse Thomas White arranged this variant of “Bethany,” a song contributed by Solomon Howe to the [ca. 1804 *Psalm-Singer’s Amusement*](http://hymntune.library.uiuc.edu/TuneCode.asp?keyTC=10277 "The Hymn Tune Index"), for the 1844 first edition of *The Sacred Harp*. Although James followed the practice of competing *Sacred Harp* revisionist Wilson Marion Cooper in adding alto parts to the book’s songs, “[i]n all tunes which could not be improved by adding alto, it has been left out.” In practice, the *Original Sacred Harp*’s editors added alto parts to the vast majority of tunes. “Edgefield” is one of only twenty-two that remain in three-part settings in the tunebook today.
